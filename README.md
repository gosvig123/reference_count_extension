# Reference Counter for VSCode

The goal of this extension is to help you understand usage of functions, classes, and methods in your code, while you are writing it.

I developed this extension to find unused functions, classes, and methods in my codebase, and understand how much care I need to take when refactoring, portrayed in a single number.

A Visual Studio Code extension that displays the number of references for functions, classes, and methods directly in your code editor.

## Features

- Shows reference counts inline next to:
  - Functions
  - Classes
  - Class methods
- Automatically updates when you edit code
- Supports multiple programming languages:
  - Python (`.py`)
  - JavaScript (`.js`, `.jsx`)
  - TypeScript (`.ts`, `.tsx`)

## Configuration
